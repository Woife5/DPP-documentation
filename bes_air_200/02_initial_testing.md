# Component testing

## Motor

The very first motor we aquired was from an old, broken hair dryer.

<!-- Theoretically, this should also work but it will be displayed weired in the vscode viewer. -->

We had to 3D-print a new fan for the motor because the installed one was already broken from being thrown away.
After extracting the motor and adding the new fan, we tested the motor with different power sources.

While testing the motor with a 18V LiPo battery we sadly overwhelmed and broke the motor.
We found however that one or maybe even two of these motors should be able to power the *BesAir 200*.
