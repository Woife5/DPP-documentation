# Final prototype


## Cosmetics

For the final prototype a number of parts were modelled in CAD. The base houses the hair dryer fan and channels the air stream out the front. The PVC pipe of the last iteration is reused and attached to the top. For the electronics two housings were designed. The main housing holds the core electronics. THe top housing holds the down firing speaker.

For the design language a slightly retro-esque style was chosen with simple core shapes, lots of chamfers and decorative ridges. Modelling was done in Fusion 360 with 3D printing already in mind. Due to the limited print volume the parts had to be split into roughly a dozen individual parts. Total printing time was roughly 70 hours.
The electronics casings were printed in transparent PLA to show off the electronics and blinking components inside.

Significant sanding and gluing work was needed to finalize the 3D Prints, especially for the base part, which warped after printing.

The main electronics casing was glued to the side of the PVC pipe, with some slots cut out to make room for electronics and routing cables. The motor and pipe mounts simply work by friction to enable easy disassembly during prototyping.
