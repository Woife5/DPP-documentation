# Conclusion

This Project has taken on a life of its own and has far surpassed our initial expectations. The freedom in this lecture has provided us with a very unique and effective learning opportunity.

Finishing the first integration test early allowed us to really make the final prototype presentable and we are more than happy with the result.
The character of the assignment also allowed us to embrace many unintentional or unavoidable problems, like the signal interference between the ESP and audio amplifier, which now significantly adds to the charm of the final product.
